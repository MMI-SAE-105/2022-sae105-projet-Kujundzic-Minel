            An interview in comic book form!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Joe Sacco, American-Maltese comic book author and journalist, has invented a graphic
            at the crossroads of journalism, documentary and comics to transcribe the memories of
            memories of Bosnian Muslims through a comic book.
            It is in the book "The Fix, a history of Sarajevo" that Joe Sacco shares with us the life and thoughts of the people of a country
            thoughts of the people of a country at war, in order to shed light on this tragedy.

            As the war was coming to an end, Joe Sacco travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on his own,
            in 1995, in order to transcribe the memory of this war, by giving a voice to the
            victims of this conflict, often forgotten by the traditional media.

            stop the killing. That's what prompted him to go to the suffering country to provide support in his own way: to ask for the
            support in his own way: to ask the victims for their side of the story and offer them a way to testify to the world.
